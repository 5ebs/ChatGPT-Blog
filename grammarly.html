            and academic papers. Whether you are writing a casual message or a formal document, Grammarly can help you produce writing that is clear,
            concise, and error-free.
          </p>

            One of the things that makes Grammarly so useful is its integration with other tools. The tool has a range of integrations with popular
            apps and platforms, including Microsoft Word, Gmail, and LinkedIn. This makes it easy to use Grammarly as you work, without having to
            switch between different apps.
