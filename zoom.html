          interface, a wide range of features, and good performance, Zoom is a versatile and reliable choice for videoconferencing.

          group into smaller subgroups. These features can be particularly useful for businesses or organizations that want a versatile
          videoconferencing platform.

          audio, which can be important for ensuring a smooth and productive videoconference. Zoom's reliability is one of the reasons it has become
          so widely adopted – businesses, schools, and other organizations around the world use it to connect with their colleagues and clients.
        </p>

          Of course, one of the main reasons people choose Zoom is because it is widely used. This can make it easier for you to connect with others
          who are already using the platform. Whether you are joining a meeting or hosting one, there is a good chance that everyone involved will be

          affordable videoconferencing solution, or a large business with more complex requirements, there is a Zoom plan that can meet your needs.
